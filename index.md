# welcome

perfect for mobile viewing. Each time you open the app, the agenda is
automatically refreshed so you're always up-to-date. attoAgenda is perfect
for a club officer or meeting Toastmaster who wants an easy way to see the club agenda, the
members assigned to each role, and which roles still need to be filled.

## FAQ

### Why doesn't attoAgenda show me more information?
attoAgenda is currently at Version 1 and only provides the most basic
(though still very useful!) agenda information. If you'd like to see more,
please send your suggestions to
[attoAgenda support](mailto:attoAgenda@gmail.com).

### Can I try the app without entering my credentials?
Sure! In the settings screen, press the button labeled
<i>Fill in settings for sample agenda.</i> That will fill in random
names in a sample agenda. It may also include a few unassigned roles.
Time to get them filled!
